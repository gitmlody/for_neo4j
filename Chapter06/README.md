# Chapter 6: Node Importance

This directory contains two python scripts and one data file:

- `page_rank.py` contains a simple python implementation of the PageRank algorithm. You can also check the [`networkx` implementation](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/networkx/algorithms/link_analysis/pagerank_alg.py#L9).

- `centrality_comparison.py` is the script which generated the summary figure, using `networkx`.

- `test_graph.edgelist` is a test graph in the [edgelist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_list) format, meaning each row contains an edge definition.
