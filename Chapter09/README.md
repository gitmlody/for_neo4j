# Chapter 9: Predicting relaitonships

Code for Chapter 9 of the book "Hands on Graph Analytics with Neo4j".

The data folder contains the graph state at t1 and t2 as edgelist format:

- [Graph at t1](data/graph_T1.edgelist)
- [Graph at t2](data/graph_T2.edgelist)

The notebook [notebooks/Link_Prediction.ipynb](notebooks/Link_Prediction.ipynb) contains the link prediction analysis performed in Chapter 9, Predicting relationships. The data extraction is performed within this notebook, but a dumped version is provided in [this file](data/adamic_adar_scores_labelled.csv).
